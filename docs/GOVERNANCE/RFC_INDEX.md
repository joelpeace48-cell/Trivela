# RFC Index & Decision Log

All significant architectural and protocol decisions in the Trivela project are recorded here.

## How the RFC Process Works

1. **Proposal** — Open a GitHub issue titled `RFC: <title>` and paste the [RFC template](RFC_TEMPLATE.md).
2. **Discussion** — At least two core contributors must review and comment within 7 days.
3. **Decision** — A maintainer updates the RFC status:
   - `Accepted` — will be implemented
   - `Rejected` — with a rationale comment
   - `Superseded` — links to the RFC that replaces it
4. **Implementation** — The PR that implements an Accepted RFC must reference the RFC number
   in its description (e.g. `Implements RFC-0003`).
5. **Close** — After the PR merges, the RFC status is set to `Accepted` and this index is updated.

> Minor changes (bug fixes, dependency bumps, docs) do not require an RFC.  
> An RFC is needed when a change affects the public API, data model, security model, or
> on-chain protocol.

## Key Decisions (Backfill)

These decisions were made before the RFC process was established; they are recorded here for
historical context.

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2024-Q3 | Express.js backend (not NestJS) for `backend/src/` | Simpler dependency tree; NestJS retained for `src/` (the NestJS app) to support existing code |
| 2024-Q3 | SQLite for dev/test, PostgreSQL for production | Avoids Docker requirement for local development |
| 2025-Q1 | OpenAPI-first design — `openapi.yaml` as source of truth | Enables contract testing, codegen, and the interactive playground |
| 2025-Q2 | Redis for rate-limit, nonce store, and distributed locking | Avoids in-process state fragility in multi-instance deployments |

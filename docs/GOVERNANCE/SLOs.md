# Service Level Objectives (SLOs), Error Budgets & Status Page

> Trivela backend — mainnet readiness definition

## 1. SLIs (Service Level Indicators)

The raw signals we measure to evaluate service health:

| SLI | Measurement |
|-----|-------------|
| **Availability** | % of non-5xx HTTP responses over a rolling 30-day window |
| **Latency (p99)** | 99th-percentile response time for `POST /api/v1/campaigns` and `GET /api/v1/campaigns/:id` |
| **Error rate** | % of requests returning 5xx over a rolling 1-hour window |
| **RPC proxy health** | % of `/health/rpc` checks returning `status: ok` in a 5-minute window |

## 2. SLOs (Service Level Objectives)

| SLO | Target | Window |
|-----|--------|--------|
| API availability | **99.5 %** | Rolling 30 days |
| p99 latency — read endpoints | **≤ 500 ms** | Rolling 7 days |
| p99 latency — write endpoints | **≤ 1 000 ms** | Rolling 7 days |
| Error rate | **< 0.5 %** | Rolling 1 hour |
| RPC proxy availability | **99 %** | Rolling 24 hours |

> These targets are intentionally achievable at mainnet launch. They will be tightened
> to 99.9 % availability after 90 days of stable operation.

## 3. Error Budgets

An error budget is the maximum allowable unreliability before the SLO is breached.

| SLO | Monthly budget (30 days) |
|-----|--------------------------|
| 99.5 % availability | **3 h 36 min** of downtime |
| < 0.5 % error rate | **0.5 %** of requests may fail per hour |

**Policy:**
- When 50 % of the monthly error budget is consumed, a Slack alert fires and the on-call
  engineer investigates.
- When 100 % is consumed, all non-critical feature work is paused until the incident is
  resolved and a post-mortem is completed.

## 4. Burn-Rate Alerting

Burn rate = (error rate observed) / (error rate budget threshold).  
A burn rate > 1 means we are consuming the budget faster than it replenishes.

| Alert | Burn rate | Window | Severity |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Fast burn — page | > 14× | 1 hour | PagerDuty P1 |
| Slow burn — ticket | > 6× | 6 hours | GitHub issue, Slack |
| Budget 50 % consumed | — | Month-to-date | Slack warning |

Configure these alerts in your observability platform (Grafana / Datadog / CloudWatch)
using the SLI measurements above.

## 5. Status Page

Publish a public status page so that integrators can check service health without
contacting support.

**Recommended setup:**
1. Use [Upptime](https://upptime.js.org/) (GitHub-native, zero cost) or Statuspage.io.
2. Monitor the following endpoints:
   - `GET /health` — overall API health
   - `GET /health/rpc` — Stellar RPC proxy
3. Add a link from `README.md` → `docs/GOVERNANCE/SLOs.md` → the status page URL.

**Current status page:** _to be configured_ — update this file with the URL once live.

## 6. Incident Response

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | On-call engineer acknowledges PagerDuty alert within 15 min |
| 2 | Incident channel opened in Slack (`#incidents`) |
| 3 | Status page updated within 30 min of confirmed outage |
| 4 | Post-mortem written within 5 business days |
| 5 | Action items tracked as GitHub issues with `post-mortem` label |

## 7. Review Cadence

SLOs are reviewed quarterly. Any proposed change goes through the RFC process
(see [RFC_INDEX.md](RFC_INDEX.md)).

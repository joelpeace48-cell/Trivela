# Mainnet Launch Readiness & Go/No-Go Gate

> **Status:** In progress — all items must be checked and signed off before any `mainnet` deploy
> workflow is approved.

This document is the single source of truth for Trivela mainnet readiness. Each item must be
checked off by a named owner and linked to verifiable evidence (merged PR, audit report, deploy
transaction, monitoring dashboard) before the go/no-go call is made.

The deploy workflow (`.github/workflows/mainnet-deploy.yml`) is gated on this checklist: a
required status check verifies the file has no unchecked boxes before the job proceeds.

## Go/No-Go Criteria

A **Go** decision requires every section below to be fully checked **and** signed off by its
designated owner. Any unchecked item is an automatic **No-Go**.

| Section | Sign-off Owner |
|---|---|
| Smart Contracts | Lead Contract Engineer |
| Security & Compliance | Security Lead |
| Backend | Backend Lead |
| Frontend | Frontend Lead |
| Infrastructure & Ops | Platform Lead |
| Financial Safety | Finance / Risk Lead |
